My name is Csaba Kir√°ly, and I believe in the innate healing capacity of all human being. I'm a licensed psychologist based in Hungary, if you wish I could be your ally as a compassionate mental health professional. I work mainly with people who feel stuck, disconnected, struggling with difficult feelings, felt-senses, or making meaning of all the fuss around us. My main topics are health psychology, taming stress, growth mindset, integrating psychedelic experiences, exploring and instrumetalising values, setting personal goals and creating action plans for and achieving them, mindfulness, embodiment, psychological first-aid, modern technology and its impact on mental health. 

At the moment I'm only available via online channels, you can reach me if you are looking for individual or group counseling, trainings or would like to discuss ideas about projects, I like to dream projects into reality. 
If you feel that you'd like to work together with me, let's contact & discuss the details. I charge based on income levels, so if you are unemployed, student, or in a challenging financial situation, don't hesitate to contact me and we will find a way!

Love is all.
