      <description>My name is Csaba Kir√°ly, and I believe in the innate healing capacity of all human being. I&amp;rsquo;m a licensed psychologist based in Hungary, if you wish I could be your ally as a compassionate mental health professional. I work mainly with people who feel stuck, disconnected, struggling with difficult feelings, felt-senses, or making meaning of all the fuss around us. My main topics are health psychology, taming stress, growth mindset, integrating psychedelic experiences, exploring and instrumetalising values, setting personal goals and creating action plans for and achieving them, mindfulness, embodiment, psychological first-aid, modern technology and its impact on mental health.</description>
