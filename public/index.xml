      <description>In this day and world it&amp;rsquo;s easy to focus on things/experiences which you don&amp;rsquo;t have. Let&amp;rsquo;s go against the main-stream &amp;amp; look into what you already have. Gratitude is the state of being grateful; a positive emotional state in which one recognizes and appreciates all the wonders what one has received. Research shows, that taking time to experience gratitude or thankfulness can make you happier &amp;amp; both physically and emotionally healthier.</description>

      <description>My name is Csaba Kir√°ly, and I believe in the innate healing capacity of all human being. I&amp;rsquo;m a licensed psychologist based in Hungary, if you wish I could be your ally as a compassionate mental health professional. I work mainly with people who feel stuck, disconnected, struggling with difficult feelings, felt-senses, or making meaning of all the fuss around us. My main topics are health psychology, taming stress, growth mindset, integrating psychedelic experiences, exploring and instrumetalising values, setting personal goals and creating action plans for and achieving them, mindfulness, embodiment, psychological first-aid, modern technology and its impact on mental health.</description>
